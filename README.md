# Arduino Relay Box

Control relays remotely with NodeJS app and Arduino.

Project includes PCB design, 3D printing, Arduino programming and NodeJS programming.

## PCB Design

The system consists of 2 boards.

The main board:

And 3 additional boards to add if needed

Im in no way a professional PCB designer, but these should work.

## 3D Printed Case

The system obviously needs a case and rather than finding a case that already exists, I wanted to design my own.

It has screw holes for the main board and 3 additional boards.
